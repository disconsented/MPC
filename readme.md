# MPC
A tool that checks TechnicLauncher monolithic .zip packs for issues

# How to use
MPC is run via command line with the choice of two flags (-file or -download) where the next argument needs to be the file/url
N.B. -download is not considered stable
E.G. java -jar MPC.jar -file examplemodpack.zip
